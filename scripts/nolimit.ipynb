       "'\\n\\nThe Yellow Wallpaper is a classic short story by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, first published in 1892. It tells the story of a woman suffering from postpartum depression and her husbandâ€™s attempts to subdue her mental illness. The story takes place in a colonial mansion, an ancestral hall that is believed to be haunted, and follows John and his wife as she slowly descends into insanity. John is practical in the extreme, having no patience with faith, an intense horror of superstition, and openly scoffing at any talk of things not to be felt and seen and put down in figures. As a physician, he does not believe his wife is truly sick, and this lack of belief further exacerbates her condition as she becomes increasingly obsessed with the patterns in the yellow wallpaper of her confinement, eventually descending into madness. The story serves as a critique of the medical treatment of women in the 19th century and is freely available as an eBook from Project Gutenberg, with no cost or restrictions.'"
